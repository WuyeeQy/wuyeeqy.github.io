# Welcome to Chenyu Zhang's Homepage

## Biography

I was born in Zizhong, Sichuan, China. I had my senior middle school education at Chengdu No.7 High School. I've been studying at School of Statistics, Beijing Normal University, since 2021.

## Study Experience

I've mastered analysis, algebra, probability, and statistics (including mathematical statistics, sampling survey) since 2021. In addition, I've studied physics, and economics (including macroeconomics, microeconomics and econometrics). I attended a causal inference course taught by Peng Ding at UC Berkeley, in the summer of 2023. In addition, I attended Joint Conference on Statistics and Data Science in China(JCSDS) and a short course covering martingale limit theory and other related topics by JCSDS and PKU, in July 2023. Now, I'm studying measure theory, functional analysis, multivariate statistics, linear model, stochastic process, and statistical limit theory.

## Reaserch Experience

I've participated in Professor Xu Guo's research group since July 2023. I mainly engage in literature research, explain the main contents to my colleagues and put forward my own ideas. Recently, I have been working on causal inference, double robust estimation, and semi-supervised learning.

## Reaserch Interests

Causal Inference, High Dimensional Data Analysis

## Honors

First-class Scholarship by Beijing Normal University

Finalist, Interdisciplinary Contest In Modeling(ICM)
